### Diffs

* [Changes from initial `saturn create`](https://github.com/apollo-passport/saturn-starter/compare/ddb9723ecfba0c05a968f3a79bb9361502dd0bcc...9eff1b8290c667d87c19f7877542fa980b9fa319)
* Example of using context at app-level

Note: There are a number of things that aren't ideal at this early stage of saturn & apollo-server.
